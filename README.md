# 3rd Winner - Finals - JOINTS 2021 Data Science Competition

**Jogja Information Technology Session (JOINTS)** was a nationwide Data Science competition conducted by Universitas Gadjah Mada, one of the most prestigious universities in Indonesia. It was conducted through Kaggle for many Indonesian data science enthusiasts. I entered the finals as seen in my other github repository, competing against 9 other teams who were the best of the best. Other than the prediction task, we were also required to present our findins, be it EDA, Modelling, Feature Engineering, and up until the business implications and recommendations. In the end, my team won **3rd place** for the first time.

The challenge was a multi-class prediction task, predicting target customers or customer segmentations for a certain Taxi company. The company wants business recommendations based on the predictions found to create better value and increase customer satisfaction by receiving appropriate services according to their so called "Group". After the prediction task is done, we were required to present our findings not only about the prediction task, but as well as business recommendations surrounding the findings.

## The Results
With a team of three whose linkedins can be found below, my team successfully surpassed 7 other teams and acquired a final score of 80.233, based on 40% kaggle score and 60% presentation score. The 2nd place team actually only had 80.5 score which is extremely close to ours, but sadly they acquired a better score in Kaggle. Comprehensive EDA was constructed, some feature engineering was ensued, and Voting Classifier ensemble was built upon 4 other hyperparameter-tuned models, Random Forest, XGBoost, CatBoost, and Extra Trees and a score of 71.571% was acquired.
